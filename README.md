# Song-Ranker
A simple program that assists the user in ranking a list of user inputted songs.

This a program designed to help me learn the basics of using Java Swing as well as well as to implement basic sorting algorithm concepts that go beyond simple hypothetical examples. The program itself uses an event-driven shellsort algorithm to sort the songs.
