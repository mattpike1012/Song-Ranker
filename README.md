# Song-Ranker
A simple program that assists the user in ranking a list of user inputted songs.

This a program designed to help me learn the basics of using Java Swing as well as well as to implement basic sorting algorithm concepts that use non-numerical values for comparison. The program itself uses an event-driven shellsort algorithm to sort the songs.
